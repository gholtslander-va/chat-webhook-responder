# chat-webhook-responder
An assortment (I hope) of webhooks to tie into Slack, HipChat, or any other chat client that uses webhooks!

## Current Integrations

### HipChat and Slack

#### Define `define: <word>` or `/define <word>`

Use the trigger_word and get a definition back. Now hosted [here](https://github.com/gholtslander-va/chat-webhook-responder-go)

#### Urban Dictionary Define `udefine: <word or phrase>` or `/udefine <word or phrase>`

Use a word or phrase and get several very (usually) naughty definitions back.
